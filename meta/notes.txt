Ch1

Compile Time vs Runtime distinction
code in C has compile time and runtime. langauge constructs such as variables an functions lost after 
compile time. Become machine code

therefore, C has no metaprogramming or introspection because code lost after compilation
in C++, some language constructs survive compilation, therefore can ask object for its class.
In java, distinction between compile time and runtime less clear.

No compilation in Ruby. Dynamic, interpreted. metaprogramming
ruby simple language, but has subtleties.

"can an object call a private method on another object of the same class?
"how can you define class methods by importing a module?

all language complications derived from few rules

Ch2

metaprogramming manipulates language constructs such as classes, modules, instance variable, etc.
everything stems from "object model"

ruby executes code within a class as it would execute any other code

class D
def x; 'x'; end
end
class D
def y; 'y'; end
end

obj = D.new
obj.x
obj.y

The first time this code is run, class D does not exist, therefore it creates it
second time the code is run, class D exists so therefore the method is just monkey patched


therefore, class keyword in Ruby closer to scope operator than class declaration
creates classes that don't exist as a side effect. Main effect is to move into context o classes

therefore, can always open existing classes and modify them on the fly. "monkey patching"
or "Open Class"

class String
  def generic_method
  end
end

libraries or modules that are imported can use open classes.

problem is when overriding methods already existing on previous classes

in Java and other languages, there is conneciton between object's class and its instance variables.
in Ruby, there isn't.
instance variables like keys in hash. each ruby object can have different keysvalues pairs

enum.grep(pattern) -> returns array of every item that matches pattern

instance variables belong to object. methods belong to class.
similar to JS design. constructor function + methods on prototype

"MyClass has a method named my_method" -> wrong. implies MyClass.my_method()
"my_method is an instance method of MyClass" -> correct. 
instance method when talking about it in terms of class. method when talking about it in relation to object


String.instance_methods == "abc".methods  ---> true
String.methods == "abc".methods  ---> false


**** Classes are objects. ****

.class -> instance of what class
.superclass -> what inheriting from

Array.superclass   -> Object
Object.superclass   -> BasicObject
BasicObject.superclass   -> nil

In Ruby, Class and Module differ by three methods. [:new, :allocate, :superclass]

Module meant to be included somewhere in code. Class meant to be instantiated. 
can be used interchangeable though

Modules directories. Constants files. Scoped underneath

any reference beginning with uppercase letter, including names of classes and modules
is a constant

constants uniquely idenitifed by paths. constants use double colon as separator

module M
class C
X = 'a constant'
end
C::X # => "a constant"
end
M::C::X # => "a constant"

::Y => # ' a root level constant '


module M
  class C
    module M2
      Module.nesting # => [M::C::M2, M::C, M]
    end
  end
end

Constants and files very similar. 


module Rake
  class Task
    # ...

module Rake is a container of constants. therefore, namespaced

Rake::Task

***
Classes are just objects.Object are instance variables with link to class.
object's methods live in object's class.

Class object of class which is subclass of Module.


****
class TEXT -> class Text  --> error because monkeypatched module Text used by Action Mailer librray

load('motd.rb') -> loads variables and constants. variables get deleted, constants do not. pollutes namespace.
load('motd.rb', true) -> creates anonymous module to namespace constants, then deletes it

require ' ' -> imports libraries


***

When method in Ruby called,

1. Method Lookup
  - when called, ruby looks into object's class and finds method there. (obj. just holds instance variabels. methods live in classes)
  - receiver: object you call method on.  my_string.reverse()  my_string is receiver
  - ancestor chain: superclass path traverse

  - therefore, method lookup: ruby goes into receiver's class and climbs ancestors chain until it finds the method

  - if no superclass specified, implicitly inherits from Object
  - superclass is instance method on object classes for lookup
  - class.ancestors gives ancestor chain. Kernel included even though its a module
  - modules included in ancestral chain. module inserted above including class

  module M1
    def my_method
    end
  end

  class C
    include M1
  end

  class D < C; end

  D.ancestors => [D, C, M1, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

  class C2
    prepend M2
  end

  class D2 < C2; end

  D2.ancestors => [D2, C2, M2, C2, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

  If multiple modules included/prepended, only the first instance listed in ancestor array

  Kernel

  print method part of Kernel. class Object includes Kernel
  Every line of Ruby always executed inside object, so can call instance methods of Kernel from anywhere

  Adding method to Kernel means adding method everywhere

2. Method execution. Needs self.

  def my_method
    temp = @x + 1
    my_other_method(temp)
  end

  When executing this above method, need to determine to whome @x belongs and on what my_other_method called
  Every line of Ruby code executed inside an object - current object. referred to with self


  private

  cannot call private methods with explicit receiver. needs to be implicit self

  When not in a scope, Ruby self is main. main is an object also top-level context

  In a class, self is the class

  class MyClass
    self          #=>   MyClass
  end


  To circumvent monkeypatching problem,

  refinement with using

  module StringExtensions
    refine String do
      def reverse
        "esrever"
      end
    end
  end

  module StringStuff
    using StringExtensions
    "my_string".reverse # => "esrever"
  end

"my_string".reverse # => "gnirts_ym"



Chapter 3 Methods


Below code is repetitive:


class Computer
  def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
    @id = computer_id
    @data_source = data_source
  end

  def mouse
    info = @data_source.get_mouse_info(@id)
    price = @data_source.get_mouse_price(@id)
    result = "Mouse: #{info} ($#{price})"
    return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    result
  end

  def cpu
    info = @data_source.get_cpu_info(@id)
    price = @data_source.get_cpu_price(@id)
    result = "Cpu: #{info} ($#{price})"
    return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    result
  end

  def keyboard
    info = @data_source.get_keyboard_info(@id)
    price = @data_source.get_keyboard_price(@id)
    result = "Keyboard: #{info} ($#{price})"
    return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    result
  end
end

Dyanmic Methods:
    - call and define methods dynamically

    - invoking methods is sending method to an object

    1.send( :+, 2)   #=> 3

ex:

Pry, the ruby command-line interpreter, is an object with interpreter's configuration

pry = Pry.new
pry.memory_size = 101
pry.memory_Size   # => 101


pry.refresh(:memory_size => 99, :quiet => false)
pry.memory_size # => 99
pry.quiet # => false

def refresh(options = {})
  defaults[:memory_size] = Pry.memory_size
  self.memory_size = options[:memory_size] if options[:memory_size]

  defaults[:quiet] = Pry.quiet
  self.quiet = options[:quiet] if options[:quiet]
end

lots of duplication for each attribute. instead:

def refresh(options = {}) 
  defaults = {}
  attributes = [ :input, :output, :commands, :print, :quiet,
                  :exception_handler, :hooks, :custom_compeltions,
                  :prompt, :memory_size, :extra_stick_locals ]

  attributes.each do |attribute|
    defaults[attribute] = Pry.send attribute
  end

  defaults.merge!(options).each do |key, value|
    send("#{key}=", value) if respond_to?("#{key}=")
  end

  true
end

send calls methods dynamically.
methods can also be defined dynamically

class MyClass
  define_method :my_method do |my_arg|
    my_arg * 3
  end
end

define_method ==>  can define name of method at runtime

first refactoring

class Computer
  def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
    @id = computer_id
    @data_source = data_source
  end

  def mouse
    component :mouse
  end

  def cpu
    component :cpu
  end

  def keyboard
    component :keyboard
  end

  def component(name)
    info = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_info", @id
    price = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_price", @id
    result = "#{name.capitalize}: #{info} ($#{price})"
    return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    result
  end
end


class Computer
  def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
    @id = computer_id
    @data_source = data_source
  end

   def self.define_component(name)
    define_method(name) do
      info = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_info", @id
      price = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_price", @id
      result = "#{name.capitalize}: #{info} ($#{price})"
      return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
      result
    end
   end

   define_component :mouse
   define_component :cpu
   define_component :keyboard
end

data_source.methods.grep(/^get_(.*)_info$/) { Computer.define_component $1 }

Above two solutions based on Dynamic Dispatch (send) and Dynamic Methods

Next solution:

Ghost Methods and dynamic proxies

since no compiler to enforce method calls, can call a method that doesn't exist

class Lawyer; end
nick = Lawyer.new
nick.talk_simple

NoMethodError: undefined method 'talk_simple' for #<Lawyer:..."
BasicObject#method_missing 


class Lawyer
  def method_missing(method, *args)
    puts "You called: #{method}(#{args.join(', ')})"
    puts "(You also passed it a block)" if block_given?
  end
end

bob = Lawyer.new
bob.talk_simple('a', 'b') do
# a block
end

You called: talk_simple(a, b)
(You also passed it a block)

override:
  def method_missing()
  end

Dynamic Proxy - object that catches ghost methods and forwards them to another object

.responds_to?
.instance_methods


Ch. 4 Blocks

Aside from blocks normally, blocks also control scope. Very important in metaprogramming

blocks are one memeber of family of "callable objects" which include procs and lambdas

blocks are an idea from functional programming languages such as LISP. idea architecture different than classes, objects


Kernel#block_given?

def a_method
  return yield if block_given?
  'no block'
end


module Kernel
  def using(resource)
    begin
      yield
    ensure
      resource.dispose
    end
  end
end

whenever code runs, its made up of two things
  - code itself
  - its binding


Kernel#local_variables
  - lists all local variables in current scope

Bindings in one scope separate from bindings in another scope

top level instance variables / global variables

@var = "top-level @var"
$var = global level var

Scope Gates 
    - three places where program leaves previous scope and opens new one:
        - Class definitions
        - Module definitions
        - Methods

"Flattening Scope in Ruby"
  - replace scope gate with method call, capture current bindings in closure, pass closure to method
  pg. 83. review this. 

BasicObject#instance_eval - evaluates block in context of an object

class MyClass
  def initialize
    @v = 1
  end
end

obj = MyClass.new

obj.instance_eval do 
  self
  @v
end

block evaluated with receiver as self.
Can call block passed to instance_eval a Context Probe - a snipet of code that dipped inside object to do something there



class C
  def initialize
    @x = 1
  end
end

class D
  def twisted_method
    @y = 2
    C.new.instance_eval { "@x: #{@x}, @y: #{@y}" }
  end
end

D.new.twisted_method # => "@x: 1, @y: "

self switches, therefore @y is nil


to merge @x and @y:


class D
  def twisted_method
    @y = 2
    C.new.instance_exec(@y)  {|y| "@x: #{@x}, @y: #{y}" }
  end
end

D.new.twisted_method # => "@x: 1, @y: 2"

This breaks encapsulation because self changes

### Context probing also useful in testing: 

In Padrino framework, there is a Logger class that manages all logging. Can context probe
in tests instead of creating new class


should 'not log static assets by default' do
  # ...
  get "/images/something.png"
  assert_equal "Foo", body
  assert_match "", Padrino.logger.log.string
end

should 'allow turning on static assets logging' do
  Padrino.logger.instance_eval{ @log_static = true }
  # ...
  get "/images/something.png"
  assert_equal "Foo", body
  assert_match /GET/, Padrino.logger.log.string
  Padrino.logger.instance_eval{ @log_static = false }


Callable Objects

  - most things in ruby are objects, except for blocks
  - however, blocks can be stored and executed later ( Proc is a block that has been stored into object )
    - inc = Proc.new {|x| x + 1 }
      inc.call(2)

Ruby also defines two Kernel methods to convert block into Proc:
  
  1. lambda
    
    dec = lambda {|x| x + 1}
    dec.class     # => Proc
    dec.call(2)    # => 3

  2. proc

    dec = proc {|x| x + 1}

  The & operator
    1. want to pass block to another method ( or another block )
    2. want to convert block into Proc

  to say "I want to use this block", need to attach binding to it.
  Must be last argument in method and prefaced with an &

  def math(a,b)
    yield(a, b)
  end

  def do_math(a,b, &operation)
    math(a, b, &operation)
  end

  do_math(2, 3) {|x, y| x * 6}   #=> 6

The real
meaning of the & is this: “I want to take the block that is passed to this method
and turn it into a Proc.” Just drop the &, and you’ll be left with a Proc again:

def my_method(&the_proc)
  the_proc
end

To convert back, use & again

def my_method(greeting)
  '#{greeting}, #{yield}'
end

my_proc = proc {"Bill"}
my_method("hello", &my_proc)

Procs vs. Lambdas 

.lambda?  => true or false if lambda

Lambda return keyword returns from lambda. For Proc, it returns out of scope

def another_double
  p = Proc.new { return 10 }
  result = p.call
  return result * 2 # unreachable code!
end

another_double  #=> 10

p = Proc.new { return 10 }
double(p)    #=>  LocalJumpError

return 10    #=> LocalJumpError
  tries to return from top level scope where p defined. gives error

2nd DIFFERENCE

The way they check arguments

Arity of two means it accepts two arguments

If calling lambda with wrong arity, it fails with ArgumentError
If calling proc with wrong arity, it fills arguments with own expectations



Method Objects

class MyClass
  def initialize(value)
    @x = value
  end

  def my_method
    @x
  end
end

object = MyClass.new(1)
m = object.method :my_method
m.call

Kernel#method   => returns method object that is callable

lambda evaluated in scope its defined in (it's a closure)
method object valued in scope of its object

Unbound Method
  - method detached from original class or module
  - Method#unbind

Callable Objects - snippets of code that can evaluate and carry own scope with them
  - Blocks, Procs, Lambdas, Methods

  **DSL - language that focuses on specific domain
    - most general purpose languages not created for specific problem
      -ex: Money in Java
    GPL (General Purpose Language - C++ , Ruby)

    Internal DSL - language that lives within a larger, general-purpose language
    Languages that have own parser are called external DSLs.


DSL

def event(description)
  puts "ALERT: #{description}" if yield
end
load 'events.rb'

event 'an event that always happens' do
  true
end

event 'an event that never happens" do
  false
end


setup do
  puts "Setting up sky"
  @sky_height = 100
end

setup do
  puts "Setting up mountains"
  @mountains_height = 200
end

event "the sky is falling" do
  @sky_height < 300
end

event "it's getting closer" do
  @sky_height < @mountains_height
end

event "whoops... too late" do
  @sky_height < 0
end



Ch. 5 Class Definitions

when defining a class, not just dictting how objects behave in future, but also running code

1. Class Macros       2. Around Aliases     3. Singleton Classes


class MyClass
  puts 'Hello'
end

> Hello

result = class MyClass
  self
end

> result #=> MyClass

Whenever in a Ruby program, always have a current object ( self )
Likewise, always have a current class (or module )

How to find current Class?

  1. At top of program, current class is Object, the class of main. (when defining method at top level, method instance method of Object)
  2. In a method, current class is the class of the current object
  3. When opening class with the class keyword (or module with the module keyword) that class becomes current class

How to obtain class you don't know the name of?
For example, if want to add a method to a class?

def add_method_to(a_class)
  # TODO: define method m() on a_class
end 

like adding CRUD to Rails

class_eval()

Module#class_eval   evaluates block in context of existing class:

def add_method_to(a_class)
  a_class.class_eval do
    def m
      'Hello!'
    end
  end 
end

add_method_to String
"abc".m     #=>   "Hello!"

instance_eval     -     only changes self
class_eval        -     changes self and current class


Conclusion: If have reference to class, can open class with class_eval or module_eval

Class Instance Variables

class MyClass
  @my_var = 1
  def self.read; @my_var; end
  def write; @my_var = 2; end
  def read; @my_var; end
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.read      #=> nil
obj.write
obj.read      #=> 2
MyClass.read  #=> 1

two instance variables are made in two different scopes

Class instance variable can be accessed only by class itself

- can also use class variables, denoted @@
- to store instance variables in a class

class C
  @@v = 1
end

class variables different from class instance variables. class variables can be accessed
by subclasses and by regular instance methods

One problem:

@@v = 1

class MyClass
  @@v = 2
end

@@v     #=> 2

Class variables dont belong to classes, they belong to class hierarchies. since
@@v defined in context of main, it belong's to main's class Object and to all descendents


Singleton Methods

Ruby allows you to add a method to a single object

str = "regulat string"

def str.title?
  self.upcase == self
end

str.title?
str.methods.grep(/title?/) 
str.singleton_methods

In static languages such as Java, object has type T because it belongs to class T
In dynammic language such as Ruby, the "type" of an object not related to class. it's the 
set of methods to which an object can respond

only matters if object responds to method

Classes are just objects and class names are constants

class methods are just singleton methods


Class Macros

ruby objects don't have attributes

class MyClass
  def my_attribute=(value)
    @my_attribute = value
  end

  def my_attribute
    @my_attribute
  end
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.my_attribute = 'x'
obj.my_attribute    #=> 'x'

class MyClass
  attr_accessor :my_attribute
end

Module::attr_*

class methods that are used in class definition. Appear like keywords because self is implicit

Class Macros Applied

class Book
  def title # ...

  def subtitle # ...

  def lend_to(user)
    puts "Lending to..."

  def self.deprecate(old_method, new_method)
    define_method(old_method) do |*args, &block|
      warn "Warning: #{old_method}() is deprecated. Use #{new_method}()."
      send(new_method, *args, &block)
    end
  end

  deprecate :GetTitle, :title
  deprecate :LEND_TO_USER, :lend_to
  deprecate :title2, :subtitle

end


Singleton Advanced

normal method lookup of object or class method means going into class and then up inheritance.

where do singleton methods belong? 
  - they can't live on objects and cannot live on classes or else become instance methods

objects in ruby can have hidden class called:
    - singleton class
    - metaclass
    - eigenclass

To get into scope of singleton class,

class << an_object
  //code here
end


"abc".singleton_class
singleton classes have only single instance and can't be inherited. 
singleton class is where object's Singleton Methods live


Method Wrappers

- wrap a method inside another method
- if there is method that other code uses, but you need to change its functionality,
wrap it in another method to get more functionality - aliases


can alias names

class MyClass
  def my_method; 'my_method()'; end
  alias_method :m, :my_method
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.my_method == obj.m

aliasing common in all Ruby code and libraries. for ex: String#size == String#length

class String
  alias_method :size, :length

More Method Wrappers

refinement - patch of code slapped directly over class
One more thing... - if call super from a refined method, can call the original unrefined method

module StringRefinement
  refine String do
    def length
      super > 5 ? 'long' : 'short'
    end
  end
end

using StringRefinement

'War and Peace'.length      # => "long"


ch. 6

Kernel#eval           - code is just text

eval takes a string that contains ruby code and evaluates it

array = [10, 20]
element = 30
eval("array << element")    #=>     [10, 20, 30]
    - useful when dynamically evaluating code

POSSIBLE_VERBS = ['get', 'put', 'post', 'delete']

POSSIBLE_VERBS.each do |m|
  eval <<-end_eval
    def #{m}(path, *args, &b)
      r[path].#{m}(*args, &b)
    end
  end_eval
end


Binding Objects
  - whole scope packaged as object
  - can create a Binding to capture local scope and carry it around
    - can then execute code in that scope by using Binding object with eval

class MyClass
  def my_method
    @x
    binding
  end
end

b = MyClass.new.my_method

eval "@x", b      #=> 1

instance_eval and class_eval can also take strings

array = ['a', 'b', 'c']
x = 'd'

array.instance_eval 'self[1] = x'
array   #=> ['a', 'd', 'c']

####
The biggest problem with string eval is security

Code Injection

def explore_array(method)
  code = "['a', 'b', 'c'].#{method}"
  puts "Exploring: #{code}"
  eval code
end

works fine, unless someone injects code. for example:

object_id; Dir glob('*')  ->  gets object_id and then lists all files in directory

Can now run all sorts of code to affect computer

One way to protect against user input is with

$SAFE global variable

[1 - 4]


How ERB works:
ex:

  <p><strong>Wake up!</strong>It's sunny <%= Time.new.strftime("%A) %></p>

  require 'erb'
  erb = ERB.new(File.read('template.rhtml'))
  erb.run


## need methodt o take snippet of Ruby code extraced from template and pass it to eval

  class ERB
    def result(b=new_toplevel)
      if @safe_level
        proc {
          $SAFE = @safe_level
          eval(@src, b, (@filename || '(erb)'), 0)
        }.call 
      else
        eval(@src, b, (@filename || '(erb'), 0)
      end
    end
  end

  ####
  new_toplevel is a method that retusn copy of TOPLEVEL_BINDING
  @src contains content of code tag
  @safe_level contains safe level required by user
  uses Proc as clean room to evaluated code in separate scope


  Kernel#load and Kernel#require take name of a source file and execute code from that file
  Similar to how eval works. Similar to evaluating a string


  Hook Methods

    - hook methods are methods that can catch object model events.
        ex:   classes inherited, modules mixed into classes, methods defined, etc.

  class String
    def self.inherited(subclass)
      puts "#{self} was inherited by #{subclass}"
    end
  end

  class MyString < String; end

  > String was inherited by MyString

  can override this method to do useful stuff

  Ruby provides many hooks. Can override all of these

  Module#included, #prepended, #method_added, #method_removed, #method_undefined

  Module#included one of the most widely used hooks

  ex:


  module M; end

  class C
    def self.include(*modules)
      puts "Called: C.include(#{modules})"
      super
    end

    include M
  end

  > Called: C.include(M)

  There is difference between Module#include and Module#included. Module#included
  is specifically a hook method. Made for when module gets included. Module#include is an instance method
  that actually needs to include some code. That is why in above exaple, we call super 
  to preserve functionality of original include method
  



Rails Notes

ActiveRecord::Base

most important class. Subclasses classes create objects from DB.

class macros like has_many, belongs_to
ghost methods that define attributes
automatically maps Duck objects to ducks table

autload is class macro. Finds the proper code


module ActiveRecord
  module Validations
    def self.included(base)
      base.extend ClassMethods
    end

    module ClassMethods
      def validats_length_of(*attrs)
    end

    def valid?
    end
  end
end

1. Instance methods of Validations becomes instance methods of ActiveRecord
2. Ruby calls ::included class method passing ActiveRecord::Base into base argument
    - this makes instance methods of ClassMethods class methods of ActiveRecord::Base
    - modules includer is called 'base class'


### Problem if multiple include/extends in code. If a second level inclusion,
first level inclusion receives class methods of second level inclusion

ActiveSupport::Concern

  - attempts to solve above problem
Concern gives instance methods and class methods

require 'active_support'

module MyConcern
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  def an_instance_method; "an instance method"; end

  module ClassMethods
    def a_class_method; "a class method"; end
  end
end

class MyClass
  include MyConcern
end

MyClass.new.an_instance_method    #=> an instance method
MyClass.a_class_method          #=> a class method

#######

module ActiveSupport
  module Concern
    class MultipleIncludedBlocks < StandardError    #:nodoc;
      def initialize
        super "Cannot define multiple 'included' blocks for a Concern"
      end
    end

    def self.extended(base)
      base.instance_variable_set(:@_dependencies, [])
    end
  end
end



Module#append_features      -  method part of Ruby library. append_features called 
just like included, however it is initially empty. only exists if you want to override it

module M
  def self.append_features(base); end
end

class C
  include M
end

C.ancestors   #   =>  [ C, Object, Kernel, BasicObject ]
  # overwriting append_features => module M not included in ancestry

module ActiveSupport
  module Concern
    def append_features(base)
      if base.instance_variable_defined?(:@_dependencies)
        base.instance_variable_get(:@_dependencies) << self
        return false
      else
        return false if base < self
        @_dependencies.each { |dep| base.send(:include, dep) }
        super
        base.extend const_get(:ClassMethods) \
          if const_defined?(:ClassMethods)
          # ...
      end
    end
  end
end


In Summary:

  Concern is a minimalist dependency management system wrapped into a single module
  In most languages, there aren't many ways to bind components together. Some inherit
  or others delegate to an object. to get fancy, can create library to manage dependencies

  * Metaprogramming should keep things simple. If it gets too convoluted, most likely trash it

Ch. 11  - Rise and Fall of alias_method_chain
    
    alias_method (target, feature) => creates two aliases

    protected - methods can be called by any instance of defining class or subclasses
            - supports explicit receivers
    private   - can only be called from within the calling object

Ch. 12  - Attribute Methods


require 'active_record'
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection :adapter  =>  'sqlite3',
                                        :database   =>  'dbfile'

ActiveRecord::Base.connection.create_table :tasks do |t|
  t.string    :description
  t.boolean   :completed
end

class Task < ActiveRecord::Base; end

task = Task.new
task.description = 'Clean up garage'
task.completed = true
task.save

task.description
task.completed?


When Ruby searching for method, walks up entire ancestor chain and then calls
method_missing if nothing found


Ruby Idioms

  Mimic Methods - used to make code cleaner. people often mistake puts for language keyword, but actually a method

  puts 'Hello, world'
  puts('Hello, world')

  obj.my_attriute = 'some value'
  obj.my_attribute=('some value')

  mimicry - animal disguising itself as another species


  class Help < R '/help'
  end

  In this context, R is a method that takes '/help' as arg and returns a class


  Nil Guard

  a ||= []

class MyClas
  attr_accessor :my_attribute

  def set_attribute(n)
    my_attribute = n
  end
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.set_attribute 10
obj.my_attribute        #=>     nil

Result: Ruby confused whether assignment to local variable caleld my_attribute
or a call to a Mimic Method called my_attribute=. When in doubt, Ruby defaults to former

to Solve:

  def set_attribute(n)
    self.my_attribute = n
  end

module Faraday
  class << self
    def new(url = nil, options = {})
      #...
      Faraday::Connection.new(url, options, &block)
    end
  end
end

['a', 'b', 'c'].push('d').shift.tap { |x| puts x }.upcase.next

class Object
  def tap
    yield self
    self
  end
end

Symbol#to_proc

class Symbol
  def to_proc
    Proc.new { |x| x.send(self)}
  end
end


DSL

langauge that focuses on specific problem



SPELLS

###   AROUND ALIAS
  - call the previous, aliased version of a method from a redefined method

class String
  alias_method :old_reverse, :reverse

  def reverse
    "x#{old_reverse}x
  end
end

"abc".reverse  #=> "xcbax"

###   BLANK SLATE
  - remove methods from an object to turn them into Ghost Methods

class C
  def method_mission(name, *args)
    "a Ghost Method"
  end
end

obj = C.new
obj.to_s      #=>   "#<C:0x007fbb2a10d2f8>"

class D < BasicObject
  def method_mission(name, *args)
    "a Ghost Method"
  end
end

blank_slate = D.new
blank_slate.to_s    #=>   "a Ghost Method"

Class Instance Variable

class C
  @my_class_instance_variable = "some value"

  def self.class_attribute
    @my_class_instance_variable
  end
end

C.class_attribute   #=> "some value"


Class Macro
  - use class method in class definition

  class C; end

  class << C
    def my_macro(arg)
      "my_macro(#{arg}) called"
    end
  end

  class C
    my_macro :x   #=> "my_macro(x) called"
  end


Clean Room
  - use an object as environment in which to evaluate block

  class CleanRoom
    def a_useful_method(x); x * 2; end
  end

  CleanRoom.new.instance_eval { a_useful_method(3) }   #=>  6

Code Processor

File.readlines("a_file_containing_lines_of_ruby.txt").each do |line|
  puts "#{line.chomp} ==> #{eval(line)}"
end

# >> 1 + 1 ==> 2
# >> 3 * 2 ==> 6
# >> Math.log10(100) ==> 2.0

Context Probe
  -  execute a block to access information in an object's context

class C
  def initialize
    @x = "a private instance variable"
  end
end 

obj = C.new
obj.instance_eval { @x }

Deferred Evaluation
  - store a piece of code and its context in proc or lambda for evaluation later

class C
  def store(&block)
    @my_code_capsule = block
  end

  def execute
    @my_code_capsule.call
  end
end

obj = C.new
obj.store { $X = 1 }
$X = 0

obj.execute
$X  #=> 1


Dynamic Dispatch
  - decide which method to call at runtime

  method_to_call = :reverse
  obj = "abc"

  obj.send(method_to_call) #=> "cba"

Dynamic Method
  - decide how to define a method at runtime

  class C
  end

  C.class_eval do 
    define_method :my_method do 
      "a dynamic method"
    end
  end

  obj = C.new
  obj.my_method       #->  "a dynamic method"

Dynamic Proxy
  - dynamically forward method calls to another object

class MyDynamicProxy
  def initialize(target)
    @target = target
  end

  def method_missing(name, *args, &block)
    "results: #{@target.send(name, *args, &block)}"
  end
end

obj = MyDynamicProxy.new("a string")
obj.reverse   # => "result: gnirts a"

Flat Scope
  -  use a closure to share variables between two scopes

class C
  def an_attribute
    @attr
  end
end

obj = C.new
a_variable = 100

#flat scope

obj.instance_eval do 
  @attr = a_variable
end

obj.an_attribute    #->  100

Ghost Method
  - response to a message that doesn't have an associated method

class C
  def method_missing(name, *args)
    name.to_s.reverse
  end
end

obj = C.new
obj.my_ghost_method   # => "dohtem_tsohg_ym"

Hook Method

override a method to intercept object model events

$INHERITORS = []

class C
  def self.inherited(subclass)
    $INHERITORS << sublcass
  end
end

Kernel Method
  - define a method in module Kernel to make method available to all objects

module Kernel
  def a_method
    "a kernel method"
  end
end

Object Extension
  - define singleton methods by mixing a module into an object's singleton class

obj = Object.new

module M
  def my_method
    'a singleton method'
  end
end 

class << obj
  include M
end

obj.my_method       #=> "a singleton method"

Prepended Wrapper

module M
  def reverse
    "x#{super}x"
  end
end

String.class_eval do
  prepend M
end

"abc".reverse     #=> "xcbax"



Refinement
  - patch a class until the end of the file or until the end 
  of the including module

module MyRefinement
  refine String do
    def reverse 
      "my reverse"
    end
  end
end

"abc".reverse   #=>  "cba"
using MyRefinement
"abc".reverse   #=>   "my reverse"

Refinement Wrapper
  - call an unrefined method from its refinement

module StringRefinement
  refine String do
    def reverse
      "x#{super}x"
    end
  end
end

using StringRefinement
"abc".reverse     # => "xcbax"


Sandbox
  -  execute untrusted code in a safe environment

def sandbox(&code)
  proc {
    $SAFE = 2
    yield
  }.call
end

begin 
  sandbox { File.delete 'a_file' }
resuce Exception => ex
  ex
end


Scope Gate
  - isolate a scope with the class, module, or def keyword

a = 1
defined? a    #=>   "local-variable"

module MyModule
  b = 1
  defined? a  #-> nil
  defined? b  #=> local-variable
end

defined? a    #=> "local-variable"
defined? b    #=>  nil


Self Yield
  - pass self to the block

class Person
  attr_accesor :name, :surname

  def initialize
    yield self
  end
end 

joe = Person.new do |p|
  p.name = 'Joe'
  p.surname = 'Smith'
end


Shared Scope
  - share variables among multiple contexts in the same Flat Scope

lamda {
  shared = 10
  self.class.class_eval do
    define_method :counter do
      shared
    end
    define_method :down do 
      shared -= 1
    end
  end
}.call

counter       #=> 10
3.times { down }
counter       #=> 7


Singleton Method
  - define a method on a single object

obj = "abc"

class << obj
  def my_singleton_method
    "x"
  end
end

obj.my_singleton_method       #=>   "x"



String of Code
  - evaluate a string of Ruby code

  my_string_of_code = "1 + 1"
  eval(my_string_of_code) #=> 2

Symbol To Proc
  - convert a symbol to a block that calls a single method

  [1, 2, 3, 4].map(&:even?)
