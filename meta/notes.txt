Compile Time vs Runtime distinction
code in C has compile time and runtime. langauge constructs such as variables an functions lost after 
compile time. Become machine code

therefore, C has no metaprogramming or introspection because code lost after compilation
in C++, some language constructs survive compilation, therefore can ask object for its class.
In java, distinction between compile time and runtime less clear.

No compilation in Ruby. Dynamic, interpreted. metaprogramming
ruby simple language, but has subtleties.

"can an object call a private method on another object of the same class?
"how can you define class methods by importing a module?

all language complications derived from few rules
